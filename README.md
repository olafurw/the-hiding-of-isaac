# the-hiding-of-isaac

This mod accepts any pull requests as long as the code follows the ideas below, your name will be added to the author list.

This mod has the following ideas.

- Stealth as the number one focus
- Ability to sneak upto enemies and deal deadly blows with knives or other items
- Enemies are unaware at first but if you move too close or they see other enemies die they start attacking
- Isaac has a few stealth abilities that can save yourself in tricky situations
- If you move undetected, you can skip the room
- If you get detected you can skip rooms via lockpicking or other items/abilities

The general feel should be.

- Each room is really dangerous and could kill you if not handled correctly
- Each room should be a puzzle where the player can look at it and think about the course of action

Item concepts:

- The Blanket
    - Entering a room puts the blanket over isaac, turning him invisible
    - He can shoot his main weapon in the cardinal directions but it has a long cooldown
    - He can move which will start a cooldown on the blanket so it cant be used immediately

- Sheep Jaw
    - Knife like item
    - Has a very long throw cooldown
    - If Isaac is hidden the hit will oneshot any enemy

Todo:

- Create multiple type of knife weapons
- Setup rooms with large hp/damage champions
- Setup detection radiuses of enemies
- And more.
